    "# Assignment: Analyzing Airline Flight Delays \n",
    "#### By Brett Hallum, Chris Ficklin, and Ryan Shuhart<br>April 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "We worked with the airline data set with a goal to use Python and its libraries to manage this large data set with out-of-core memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted answers the following questions with use of the split-apply-combine technique:\n",
    "* Which airports are most likely to be delayed flying out of or into?\n",
    "* Which flights with same origin and destination are most likely to be delayed?\n",
    "* Can you regress how delayed a flight will be before it is delayed?\n",
    "* What are the most important features for this regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the scope of answering these questions, the models were cross-validated using sampling techniques and evalutated using criteria and standards set up through the FAA.\n"

    "Dask is a partial implementation of Pandas to split a large dataframe into many smaller Pandas dataframes. This library uses parallel computation for its analytics and is composed of a task scheduler and Big Data collections, such as the dataframe we will use. Dask is fast, flexible and scalable for many clusters with 1000â€™s of cores. Dask is easy to use because it mimics a lot of the API syntax of pandas and numpy to calculate various values. The data frames and groupby functions are nearly identical between dask and pandas."

    "For the average delay by year, there dont seem to be many deviations. There are two significant years higher than 10 minutes in 2000 and 2007. We aloso see several years with low average delays less than 6 minutes including 1991, 1992, 2002, and 2003.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the average delay by month, we see December having the largest delay times with an average delay time of nearly 12 minutes. The month of September is the lowest month of delays. These highs and lows are most likely attributed to the flight patterns of people. Many people do not travel in September because school is starting back up and people have already taken time off for the summer. There are also a lot more travel conducted during December because of Christmas, one of the more popular holidays for travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting plot to observe is the average delay by hour. It seems that there is a constant increase in delay times as the day gets going. From 6am to around 8pm, there is a constant increase in the average delay time. It starts less than 2 minutes on average for delays and increases all the way up to nearly 14 minutes. After 8pm, the time decreases again into the early morning, leveling back to \"low\" levels less than 4 minutes around 2am.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average delay by day of the week does not have much to note. Delays are fairly stable around 8 minutes on average for each day, with day 5, Friday, being higher at 10 minutes. This is most likely due to high travel frequency on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we see the average delay be carrier. A few of the first carriers in the plot have average delay times larger than 12 minutes. This decreases, but none of the carriers seem to fall below an average delay time of 8 minutes. This is most likely due to the fact that nearly every carrier has to deal with similar factors such as weather, airport issues, and leveraging the control tower for take off. No single carrier should have vastly different times than the others if all things are equal for every carrier."

    "### Regression Results\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted regression on the data set and wanted to determine what variables may affect the departure delay time the most. We conducted the analysis 5 times with different seeds to cross-validate and select different samples. Due to the size of the data set and the limitations of dask, we selected variables based on previous observations and visualizations. The main variables we wanted to observe were the hour the flight was supposed to take off and the distance it was to travel. We conducted this regression twice. The first run was prior to scaling the data to one another while the second took this scaling into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first run, we saw that hour was the dominant factor of these two values in predicting the time of delay for a flight. The hour variable had an average coefficient of 0.727 compared to the 0.001 value of distance. This is a skewed value however because the hour value ranges from 0 to 23 and the distance value can be quite large depending on the flight being conducted. To observe this relationship appropriately, we scale the hour and distance values. After doing this scaling, we see coeffiecients of 3.453 for the departure hour and 0.820 for the distance. This means that the delay time for departure can be calculated with a factor of 3.453 multiplied by the scaled hour and a factor of 0.82 multiplied by the scaled flight distance. The Mean Squared Error was 866.89, slightly larger than the non-scaled analysis of 804.55, with an R Squared value of -0.067.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second analysis added the age of the plane to the analysis. The age of the plane was represented in number of months and was calculated using the difference between the first recorded flight and the flight being conducted. In this analysis, we continued using the hour of departure and distance of the scheudled flight. When we sclaed the three variables, we saw coefficients of 3.938 for the hour of departure for the flight, 0.623 for the distance of the flight, and 0.154 for the age of the plane. This means that the later in the day the flight is, the longer it is going, and the older the plane is, the longer departure delay the flight will have. The hour plays the largest role in affecting the delay time when we use these coefficients. The Mean Squared Error of this regression for 40% of the data was 866.01, which is just slightly better than the initial regression using just hour of departure and distance of flight."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a new \"big data\" alternative for those preferring the Python language. Although it is in active development by Continuum.io it still lacks certain features, such as, a drop-in generalized linear model. The dask dataframe is easy to use as it follow the popular pandas convention, however, unfortunately it does not allow for row slicing. Row slicing is convient for mini-batch operations that could have been usefull in this case. It is possible to do row slicing with dask arrays, but the data must be on disk using a compatible storage. Parquet is not compatible. Therefore, at this stage of the dask project, dask dataframes work well with out-of-core classification machine learning, and dask arrays are suitable for out-of-core regression for techniques that can utilize mini-batch operations. The dask-glm project looks to tackle out-of-core and distributed regression problems."

    "#### Summary\n",
    "Dask allows for out of core management of data sets. CSV files are universal, but slow to process. Converting to parquet file format, speeds up the process by a factor of 38. Using the gzip compression, reduces size on disk from 13.8gb to 1.36 or about 10% of the uncompressed size. This comes in handy for a distributed processing in a cluster since not as much network bandwidth would be needed. The trade off of compression is a 42.4% increasing in processing time, however, 3 additional seconds is hardly noticable, but might be more of an issue for other tasks. "
